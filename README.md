# Predicting Student Performance based on Study Hours
This is a simple linear regression project that aims to predict the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours per day.
The dataset used for this project is small and consists of only two variables, which are the number of hours studied and the percentage obtained.

## Dataset:
The dataset contains two columns: Hours and Scores.The Hours column represents the number of study hours per day, while the Scores column represents the percentage obtained by the student.

### Model:
This project uses simple linear regression to predict student performance based on the number of study hours.Simple linear regression is a statistical method that examines the linear relationship between two continuous variables.
The model is trained on the dataset and then used to predict the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours per day.

#### Usage:
To use this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine along with the following libraries:

•	pandas
•	numpy
•	matplotlib
•	scikit-learn

Once you have installed the required libraries, you can run this file in Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible environment.
The notebook contains the code for loading and preprocessing the dataset, training the model, and making predictions. 
It also includes visualizations of the data and the results of the model.

##### Results:
These results indicate that the model is a good fit for the dataset and can be used to predict student performance based on the number of study hours per day.
The model predicts that a student who studies for 9.25 hours per day will score approximately 93.43%.

###### Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how simple linear regression can be used to predict student performance based on the number of study hours per day.The results show that there is a strong positive correlation between the number of study hours and the percentage obtained by the student.
